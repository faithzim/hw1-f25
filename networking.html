            <h2>What is Networking?</h2>
            <p>
                Networking is all about making connections with new people! Building your network means meeting lots of
                different kinds of people, both within your industry of interest and outside it because you never know
                where that next job might come from. You already have a network of your family and friends, and being a
                UMSI student gives you access to student/alumni networks as well!

            <h2>Ways to Network</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Attend Events:</strong> The University, UMSI, and many other organizations host networking
                    events and career fairs that can help you build connections with other students and professionals. A
                    connection can also come from chatting with a speaker after a talk or going to office hours with
                    your professors!</li>
                <li><strong>Connect With Your Current Network:</strong> The people you know already may have connections
                    that can help you! Tell people about your work and your interests, and see if they know anyone like
                    you. Chances are, they do!</li>
                <li><strong>Message Interesting People:</strong> Sending a LinkedIn message to a stranger can sound
                    daunting, but initiative and genuine interest goes a long way, especially to a UMich alum! In
                    general, people want to help you if they can, so be bold.</li>
