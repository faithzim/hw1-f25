            <h2>Starting and Staying Organized</h2>
            <p>
                When you're finding, applying, and interviewing for jobs, it can be hard to keep track of all the moving
                pieces. It's important to log your applications somewhere that works for you. It's hard to reorganize if
                you lose track, so commit to your system early and recommit yourself to its upkeep with every
                application.

            <h2>Consistency is Key</h2>
            <p>
                Set goals for your applications. Maybe you want to apply to three jobs per week or have two coffee chats
                per month. Consider and set your goals ahead of time to make it easier to stick to them. Maybe team up
                with a friend to hold each other accountable.

            <h2>Embrace Variety</h2>
            <p>
                Search for many different keywords and job titles; don't get too committed to a certain title too early.
                Companies use a variety of titles to imply very similar job descriptions, so take the risk of clicking
                on something that you might not be 100% sure about. It could be your next favorite job!
